// so to block out everything I need to do, let's start with what I want

// const { render } = require("@testing-library/react");

// I WANT TO MAKE A PAGE THAT SHOWS GUITARS, AND YOU CAN CLICK TO BUY THEM AND PUT THEM IN YOUR 'CART' OR MARK THEM AS 'SOLD' OR 'LIKE/DISLIKE'

// I need to make the page render first. Once I know the route is properly connected, I can start working on making a state to display a list of guitars
